# Data for replication
The folder **data** contains all the parameters and samples used in our experiments.
1. In the folder **Solution_DRO_SDRO_SAA**, the file [Parameters.xslx](data/Solution_DRO_SDRO_SAA/Parameters.xlsx) includes the fixed cost, capacity, transportation cost ,and penalty cost, which are used in the experiments of Section 6.1. Furthermore, the files [Parameters_DRO.xlsx](data/Parameters_DRO.xlsx), [Parameters_SAA](data/Parameters_SAA.xlsx) and [Parameters_SDRO](data/Parameters_SDRO.xlsx) include the parameters of the DRO model, SAA model and S-DRO model proposed in our paper, respectively.  
2. The file [d_sample_set_seasonality.xlsx](data/Out_of_Sample_seasonality/d_sample_set_seasonality.xlsx) in the folder **Out_of_Sample_seasonality** contains 100 sets of randomly generated demand samples with seasonal information. 
3. The file [d_sample_set_nonseasonality.xlsx](data/Out_of_Sample_nonseasonality/d_sample_set_nonseasonality.xlsx) in the folder **Out_of_Sample_nonseasonality** includes 100 sets of randomly generated demand samples without seasonal information.
4. The file [demand_observation_2019.xlsx](data/Real_Case_2019/demand_observation_2019.xlsx) in the folder **Real_Case_2019** contains the true observation of the demand in each quarter of 2019.
5. In the folder **Out_of_Sample_Robustness**, the files [d_sample_set_phi_0.xlsx](data/Out_of_Sample_Robustness/d_sample_set_phi_0.xlsx),...,[d_sample_set_phi_5.xlsx](data/Out_of_Sample_Robustness/d_sample_set_phi_5.xlsx) contain 100 sets of randomly generated demand samples with different proportion of the worst-case distribution \phi \in {0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5}, respectively.
6. In the folder **CPU_Time_Uncapacitated_Problem**, the files [Uncapacitated_I_10_J_10_K_1.npy](data/CPU_Time_Uncapacitated_Problem/Uncapacitated_I_10_J_10_K_1.npy),..., [Uncapacitated_I_20_J_50_K_5.npy](data/CPU_Time_Uncapacitated_Problem/Uncapacitated_I_20_J_50_K_5.npy) contain the parameters of the uncapacitated S-DRO model with the different number of the potential location sites I, customer sites J and states K. 
7. The files [Capacitated_I_10_J_10_K_1.npy](data/Algorithm_Performance/Capacitated_I_10_J_10/Capacitated_I_10_J_10_K_1.npy),...,[Capacitated_I_20_J_50_K_5.npy](data/Algorithm_Performance/Capacitated_I_20_J_50/Capacitated_I_20_J_50_K_5.npy) in the folder **Algorithm_Performance** contain the parameters of the capacitated S-DRO model with the different number of the potential location sites I, customer sites J and states K.
